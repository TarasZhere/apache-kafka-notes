# Run kafka with zookeeper

Apache Kafka depends on Zookeeper for cluster management. Hence, prior to starting Kafka, Zookeeper has to be started. There is no need to explicitly install Zookeeper, as it comes included with Apache Kafka.

Make sure your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set first, as instructed in the Install Java section, so that Java 11 is used when doing `java -version`

## Start Zookeeper

Start the zookeeper with the starting script and reference to the zookeeper properties folder!

```bash
zookeeper-server-start.sh ~/kafka_2.13-3.5.1/config/zookeeper.properties
```

## Start Apache Kafka

Open another Terminal window and run the following command from the root of Apache Kafka to start Apache Kafka.

```bash
kafka-server-start.sh ~/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/config/server.properties
```
