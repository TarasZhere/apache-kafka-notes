# Kafka Brokers

A kafka cluster is composed by <u> multiple brokers</u><sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>. Each **broker** can be identified from a <u>unique id</u><sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>; for example, we can have brokers 101, 102, and 103 in a cluster. Each broker contains certain topics and partitions.

-   After connecting to any broker, the client<sup>[[3]](#3)</sup> will be connected to the entire cluster. Kafka clients have smart mechanisms for that. They will know in advance how to connect to other brokers.
-   A good number of brokers is three, but for a bigger cluster, it can go over 100 brokers.

## Brokers and Topics

-   Say we have **Topic-A** with **3 partitions** and **Topic-B** with **2 partitions**. ⚠️ Note that the data is distributed, and the Broker 103 does not have **Topic-B** ⚠️
-   This is called <u>horizontal scaling</u>. The more partitions and brokers, the more data is spread out across the cluster<sup>[[4]](#4)</sup>.

## Broker Discovery

-   Every kafka broker is also called **bootstrap server**.
-   You can connect to only <u>one broker</u> to discover all other brokers and partitions. Kafka will know how to connect to the entire cluster (smart clients).
-   Also, each broker knows about all other brokers, topics, and partitions (metadata)

Any Kafka client connects to a bootstrap broker, and the brokers (metadata request) respond with a list of all brokers, topics, and partitions.
