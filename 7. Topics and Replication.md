# Topic replication factor

Topics should have a replication factor <u>greater</u> than 1<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>
This way, if a broker is down, it can be replaced by another broker with a replica of the topic.

### Example

**Topic-A** has 2 partitions and **replication factor** of 2.

</center>

**Say we lose broker 102**. We still have all partitions thanks to the replication factor of two. Broker 101 and Broker 103 can still serve all the data.

# Leader of a partition

At any time, only one broker can be the leader for a given partition.

> Producers can <u> only send the data </u> to the leader of a specific partition.

Other brokers will replicate the data, given the replication factor. ⚠️ If a replica is fast enough, it is called ISR (in-synch replica)

 # Default producers & consumers' behavior with leader
 - Kafka producers can only write to the leader broker of the partition
 - Kafka consumers, by default, will read from the leader broker of a partition

## Later versions: Kafka v2.4

-   From this version of Kafka, it is possible to read from the closest replica (broker server).
-   Help to improve latency and decrease network costs if using the cloud if things are in the same data center.

<a name="1"></a> [1] - The replication factor should usually be between 2 and 3 in the production environment, most commonly at 3. When testing, 1 is fine.
