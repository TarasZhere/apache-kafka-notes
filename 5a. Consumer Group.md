# Consumer Group

All consumers within an application read as a consumer group. Each consumer from a group reads from an exclusive partition.

## Too many consumers

Each consumer reads from one partition in this case, but the extra consumer will be inactive.

## Multiple consumer groups in one topic

In Apache Kafka, it is common to have multiple consumer groups reading from the same topic. _Why would you have multiple consumer groups?_ Because each group represents one service. If we go back to the track example, in section one, a consumer group may represent notification systems, another will represent location service, and so on.

## Consumers Offset

Kafka stores the offset at which a consumer group has been reading inside the Kafka topic. The committed offsets are in the Kafka topic variable, '\_\_consumer_offets`. The variable begins with two lower dashes because it is an internal<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> component in a topic.

-   The offsets committed are in the `__consumer_offets` Kafka topic.
-   When a consumer in a group has processed data received from Kafka, it should be periodically committing the offsets (the Kafka will write to `__consumer_offsets`, **NOT** the group itself)
-   Therefore, if a consumer dies, it can start consuming messages from where it has left off to the committed consumer offset.

## Delivery semantics for consumers

-   By default, Java consumers will automatically commit offsets (at least once)
-   There are three different types of semantic (committing methods)
    -   **At least once** (Usually preferred)
        -   Offset is committed after a message is processed
        -   If the process goes wrong, the message will be read again
        -   This can result in a duplicate process of messages. Make sure the processing of messages is idempotent (it does not affect it if some messages are read twice.)
    -   **At most once**
        -   Offsets are committed as soon as messages are received
        -   If the process goes wrong, some messages will be lost
    -   **Exactly once**
        -   For Kafka ➡️ Kafka workflows: uses the transactional API (easy with Kafka streams API).
        -   For Kafka ➡️ External Systems Workflows: use an idempotent consumer.
