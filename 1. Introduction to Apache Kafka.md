# Introduction to Apache Kafka

Companies start when they have a **source system** that produces data, which has to go into a **target system**.

As companies grow, they have many **source systems** and many **target systems**. Now, data integration has become challenging. For example, developers must write 24 integration methods to move the data if we have six source and four target systems.

Now, everything looks better, and it is more scalable.

### Example

Here is a real-world example of how Apache Kafka uses different source and target systems.

## Why Apache Kafka

1. Apache kafka is _distributed, resiliant, and fault tollerant_.
2. Horizontal Scalability:
    1. Scale up to 100s of brokers
    2. Sustains millions of messages per second

## Use case

-   Messaging systems
-   Activity Tracking
-   Gather metrics from many different locations
-   Application logs gathering
-   Stream Processing
-   De-couple systems
-   Integrates with big data techs like Spark, Flink, and more
-   Microservices publishing and subscription
