# Kafka Topics

> A **Topic** is a stream<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> of data. A topic is identified by its **name**.

-   Like a table in a database but without the constraint of an RDMS.
-   You can also have many topics. A **topic** is identified by its name.
-   Topics support any message format
    -   JSON
    -   binary
    -   text
    -   numbers
    -   whatever
-   The sequence of a message is called a **data stream**.
-   You cannot query data. Use **producers** to write data and **Consumers** to read the data stream.

## Partitions and Offests

Topics are split into **partitions** (e.g. 100s), and the messages within each partition are ordered. Each message in a **partition** gets an incremental _id_ called **offset**.

## Important things to notice about Kafka Topics

1. _Kafka Topics_ are **IMMUTABLE**: once the data is written into the partition, it cannot be changed!
2. Data is kept only for a limited time (one week by default, but can be configured).
3. Offset only have a meaning for specific partitions:
    - Offset 3 in partition 0 is different from offset 3 in partition 1!
    - **Offset IDs are not reused** even if previous messages have been deleted.
4. Order of messages is guaranteed across one partition but not multiple partitions.
5. Data is assigned at a **random partition** unless a key is provided.
6. A Topic can have as many partitions as you need.
