# Zookeper

-   Zookeeper **manages Kafka brokers** (keeps a list of them)
-   Zookeeper helps perform **leader election for partition**
-   Zookeeper sends notifications to Kafka for changes (such as broker die, broker come up, new/delete topic, etc.)
-   Kafka from `v0` to `v2.x` <u>cannot work without</u> **Zookeeper**
-   Kafka `v3.x` <u>can work without</u> Zookeeper<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>. Using **Kafka Raft** instead.\
-   Kafka `v4.x` <u>will not have</u> Zookeeper.
-   Zookeeper, by design, operates with an odd number of servers (1, 3, 5, 7)
-   Zookeeper has a concept of leaders (writes) and followers (reads)
-   Zooker does not store consumer offsets with Kafka > `v0.10`

## Should you use Zookeeper

-   With kafka brokers:
    -   Yes, until Kafka 4.0 is out while waiting for Kafka without Zookeeper to be production-ready
-   With Kafka clients
    -   Over time, the Kafka clients and CLI have been migrated to leverage the brokers as connection endpoint instead of Zookeeper
    -   Since Kafka `v0.10`, consumer offset stores in the Kafka broker and Zookeeper and must not connect to Zookeeper as it deprecated.
    -   Since Kafka `v2.2`, the `kafka-topics.sh` CLI references Kafka brokers and not Zookeeper for topic management (creation, deletion, etc.), and the zookeeper CLI argument is deprecated.
    -   Zookeeper is also less secure than Kafka, and therefore, its ports should only be opened to allow traffic from Kafka brokers and not Kafka clients
