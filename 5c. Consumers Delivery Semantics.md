# Consumers Delivery Semantics

## At most once

> Offsets are commited as soon as the batch is received. If processing goes wrong the message will be lost.

## At least once (prefered)

> Offsets are commited after the messages are processed. if the processing goes wrong the message will be read again. This can result in duplicate processing of messages. We must use **idempotent** consumers if we do not want duplicate messages.

To achive idempotent consumer you can use:

-   The `id` of the message as `id` to store in the database (if it has one).
-   if it doesn't you can use the the record `topic` name + `partition` where it was coming from, and the `offset` of the message. Code example:

```java
// Say record is a type ConsumerRecord<,>
String id = record.topic() + '_' + record.partition() + '_' + record.offset();
```

## Exactly once

> Can be achived for Kafka. ➡️ kafka workflow using the transactional API (easy with Kafka streams API). For Kafka ➡️ Sink workflow, use idempotent consumer
