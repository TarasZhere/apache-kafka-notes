# Consumers

Consumers read data from a topic (identified by name) - pull model

### Some Rules

-   **Consumers automatically know from which broker to read from**.
-   In case of broker failure **consumers know how to recover**.
-   Consumer may **choose to read from any partition** or can **read from multiple partitions**.
-   **data is read from low to high offset**<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> <u>within partition</u>.

## Consumers deserialization

> Deserialization indicates how data is transformed from bytes into objects/data.

Deserialization is used on both key and message. Kafka knows which datatype the serialized object is; therefore, uses the dedicated deserialized<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup> type. Common deserializers are:

-   String (JSON incl.)
-   int, float, double
-   Avro
-   Protobuf

The serialization and deserialization must not change during a topic lifecycle<sup>[[3]](#3)</sup>.

<a name="2"></a> [2] - Different types of Deserializers are IntegerDeserializer, StrignDeserializer, and so on...

<a name="3"></a> [3] - You must not absolutely change the deserialization/serialization of a topic lifecycle. Create a new topic instead!
