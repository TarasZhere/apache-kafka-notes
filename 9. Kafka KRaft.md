# Kafka KRaft

In 2020, the Apache Kafka project began to work for removing Zookeeper as a dependency (KIP-500)

-   Zookeeper showed some scaling issues when having more than 100,000 partitions.
-   By removing Zookeeper, Apache Kafka can
    -   Scale in millions of partitions, and becomes easier to maintain and set up
    -   Improves stability and makes it easier to monitor, support, and administer
    -   Single security model for the whole systems
    -   Single process to start with Kafka
    -   Faster controller shout-down and recovery time
-   Kafka `v3.x` now implements the Raft Protocol (KRaft) to replace Zookerper
    -   ⚠️ Kafka with KRaft Module is production ready from version `v3.3.1` aka `(KIP-833)` ⚠️
    -   Also, Kafka 4.0 will be released only with KRaft (not Zookeeper)

## Kafka KRaft Architecture

Instead of being managed by a quorum of servers in Zookeeper, now Kafka brokers can handle themselves with a **quorum controller** where there is only one leader in the quorum of brokers.

## KRaft performance improvement

Time shout-down operations in Apache Kafka with 2 million partitions. _Faster is better._
