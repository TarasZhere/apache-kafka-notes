# Safe Kafka Producer Setting

Here are the following setting you should consider for "safety":

-   Kafka `v3.0+`, Producer is safe by default settings:
    -   `acks=all`
    -   `enable.idempotence=true`
-   Kafka `v2.8-`, producer by default comes with:
    -   `acks=1`
    -   `enable.idempotence=false`
-   **Do use** safe producers whenever is possible
-   **Always use updated Kafka Clients**

## Setting if you want safe producers in Kafka `v2.8` or lower

-   `acks=all`
-   `min.insync.replicas=2`
-   `enable.idempotence=true`
-   `retries=MAX_INT`
-   `delivery.timeout.ms=120000`
-   `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5`
    -   ensures max performnce while keeping messages ordering
