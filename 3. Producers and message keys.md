# Producers

-   **Producers write data to topics** (which are made of partitions).
-   Producers know which partitions to write in advance (and which Kafka broker has it).
-   In case of broker failure, **Producers** will automatically recover

This load is balanced across brokers thanks to the number of partitions! This is why Kafka scales: each partition will receive from one or more producers.

## Message Keys

-   Producers can send a key with the message (string, num, ...).
-   if `key == null`: data is sent by round (partition 0, then 1, then two, and so on...)
-   if `key != null`: data is sent to the same partition for the same key.
-   Keys are often sent if you need a specific ordering for specific fields

## Kafka messages atonomy

```js
messages:[
	{ /* message */
		key: [binary || null],
		value: [any || null],
		compression_type: [None,'.gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd'],
		Headers: {
			[key]: [value],
			[key]: [value],
			...
		},
		partition: [int],
		offset: [int],
		timestamp: [timestamp]
	},
]
```

Then, the message a producer creates is sent to Apache Kafka for storage.

## Messages Serializer

-   **Kafka only accepts bytes** as an input from a producer and sends bytes out as an output to consumers.
-   Our objects/data are often not bytes; therefore, we need to perform **messages serialization to transform them into bytes**.
-   They are used only on the value and key of the message.
-   Kafka automatically detects the data type of the value or key and calls the appropriate function to transform it into bytes:
    -   string (JSON included)
    -   int, float, double
    -   Avro
    -   Protobuf

## Kafka messages hashing

-   A Kafka Partitioner is a code logic that takes a record and determines to which partition to send it into.

-   **Key hashing** is used to determine the mapping of a key into a partition
-   The default Kafka partitioner, the keys are hashed using the `murmur2` algorithm ⏬️

```c++
targetPartition = Math.abs(
	Utils.murmur2(keyBytes) % (partitions - 1)
)
```
