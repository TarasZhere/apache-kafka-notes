# Producer Retries

Developers can expect to receive Exceptions from the producer, and they need to be handled, or the data can be lost.
Example of exception: `NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS` due to `min.insync.replicas`

There is a **`retry setting`**:

-   Default `0` for Kafka <= `v2.0`
-   Deault `Integer.MIN_VALUE` for Kafka >= `v2.1`

There is also a **`retry.backoff.ms`** settingis by default 100ms
